# GenEd 1091 Final Project: Grow (Frontend)
### An interactive and full-stack productivity website inspired by three famous Chinese philosophers: Confucius (Kongzi), Han Feizi, and Zhuangzi.


### Made by: Nadine Han '25 and Julianna Zhao '25


**Stacks:** React.js/CSS (Frontend), Node.js/GraphQL (Backend), Figma (UX/UI)

## Inspiration
Many Chinese schools of thought tackle the issue of cultivation, whether it is of oneself, the government, or (quite literally) agricultural fields. Since our project aims to modernize these philosophies by crystallizing them into separate strategies for maintaining one's productivity in our current society, we chose the title **Grow**: simple and sweet. 


Of course, not all philosophies are the same (as we can see from more anti-Confucian variations of Legalism), so we designed and coded separate pages for each philosopher: a habit log based on the rituals and self-cultivation of Confucianism; a goal and law tracker for the regulation of oneself reminiscent of the harsh governance strategies of Legalism; and a meditation application that randomly generates one of three options to display, much like the go-with-the flow nature of Zhuangzi and Daoism.
